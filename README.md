This project has multiple python files, not all of which need to be run to generate the final graphs. 

The file "chpl_annual_2012-22_totals.xlsx" was created in excel using data found in the CHPL annual board reports. The original files, all pdfs, are located in an assets subfolder labled "CHPL Annual Report 2012-22". My next step for this project is to create a SQL database of this same information and read that database in to the analysis file instead.
